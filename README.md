# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Quantitative Analysis Project

## Objective
To implement and evaluate various NLP techniques for quantitative analysis of textual data.

## Tasks

1. **Data Collection**
   - Obtained dataset with text data (movie reviews, news articles, or product reviews).
   - Used publicly available datasets like IMDb reviews, news articles from Kaggle, or Amazon product reviews.

2. **Pre-processing**
   - Cleaned the text data by removing special characters and stop-words.
   - Performed tokenization and lemmatization.
   - Converted the text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Implemented a sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM) and deep learning (LSTM, BERT).
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Topic Modeling**
   - Applied topic modeling techniques (LDA, NMF) to identify and extract key topics from the text data.
   - Visualized the topics and interpreted the results.

5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Used an NER model to identify and classify entities (persons, organizations, locations) in the text data.
   - Evaluated the performance of the NER model with appropriate metrics.

6. **Word Frequency Analysis**
   - Performed a word frequency analysis to identify the most common words and phrases in the dataset.
   - Visualized the results using bar charts or word clouds.

7. **Text Classification**
   - Developed a text classification model to categorize the text data into predefined classes (e.g., spam detection, genre classification).
   - Compared the performance of different models (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Neural Networks).

8. **Clustering**
   - Applied clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group similar texts.
   - Evaluated the clusters using metrics like silhouette score and visualized the clusters.

## Deliverables

- **Codebase**: Well-documented code implementing the above tasks.
- **Report**: Detailed report explaining the methods used, results obtained, and interpretations.
- **Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and word clouds supporting the analysis.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of the project and future directions.
